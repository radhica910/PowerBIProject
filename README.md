Power BI is an interactive data visualization tool that helps to communicate data and meaningful insights through graphs and charts to clients.

**Superstore Data: Leveraging sales and profits of superstore**

I led a project for a superstore analyzing which product, regions, categories, and customer segments to target or avoid identifying the sales and profits trends and growth opportunities. Using power query, I removed unnecessary columns such as customer name, product name, country, etc. Then I applied cleaned data in Power BI for further analysis. My focus is on areas such as region, segments, category, number of orders, and shipping mode.

Through my analysis, I discovered many meaningful insights. Since there are different ship modes like first class, same day, standard class, and second class. But the highest contribution to profit is by first class shipping mode whereas second class shipping mode contributes least to profit. I found that the sales value for copiers under the technology category is higher; thus, it automatically increases the sales value of technology. In 2018, the maximum number of orders was from the central region at 40.48%, and the least was from the south region at 14.29%. But the highest sales of technology are from the south region and lower sales of technology from the central region. Also, sales are higher for the home office segment and lower for the consumer segment.

Using these insights, I would like to provide recommendations to increase sales and profit, such as the first-class shipping mode is crucial for profitability, so it is essential to maintain service quality and customer satisfaction. On the other hand, adjustments should be made to improve the second-class shipping mode's profitability by exploring opportunities to optimize costs in this mode. Expanding the range of technology products, improving marketing strategies, and exploring cross-selling opportunities can capitalize on the higher sales value of copiers and also other technological items. The south region shows potential for growth in technology product sales, so efforts should be focused on expanding its market presence there. By identifying high-demand products and tailoring marketing campaigns, concentrating on the home office segment can boost sales in that category. Strategies should also be developed to address challenges and increase sales in the consumer segment, such as competitive pricing and improved customer support.

In conclusion, a dynamic and data-driven approach will help optimize profitability and improve overall business performance.
